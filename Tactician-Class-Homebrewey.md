# Tactitician
Tacticians have spent their life learning and observing others to gain their knowledge and skills. They are experts in applying their intellect in novel and effective ways. Not all Tacticians come from academic or studious backgrounds. Some have learned to survive using their wit and quick thinking. Others learned various trades and moved from job to job, taking a bit from each experience with them. A few come from other disrepute origins. The Tacticians mind is one that excels at problem solving and applying solutions quickly, efficiently, and with precision. Having been told most of their life they have what it takes to be whatever they want to be, they choose to be what they already are; a master of adaptation and ingenuity.

#### Level 1: Arcane Mimicry
Through observation and relentless persistence you have learned how to use Spell Scrolls in unique and effective ways without the need for natural spell casting abilities.

You can use and identify any Spell Scroll not on your spell list up to a Spell Scroll level equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 0). Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells. When you use a Spell Scroll with this feature, you must first succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 plus the spell's level). On a successful check, you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed check, the scroll disintegrates.

You can use this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. 

When you reach certain Tactitician levels, you gain more uses of this feature as shown in the Mimcry column of the Tactitician Features table.

#### Level 1: Weapon Mastery
Your training with weapons allows you to use the mastery properties of two kinds of weapons of your choice with which you have proficiency, such as Daggers or Hand Crossbows. Whenever you finish a long rest, you can change the kinds of wepons you choose. For example, you could switch to using the mastery properties of Short Swords and Quarterstaffs.

#### Level 1: Broad Exposure
Your years of experience with obscure information and travel has taught you useful skills.

**Languages.** You know two languages of your choice from the language tables in chapter 2.

**Organized.** When you take the Magic Action to use a Spell Scroll, as a part of that action you can retrieve a Spell Scroll from a Pouch or a Map or Scroll Case. A Pouch is able to hold a total of 6 Spell Scrolls and a Map or Scroll Case can hold 5 Spell Scolls.


#### Level 2: Duplicate
Your years of studying Spell Scrolls has given you a keen eye and careful hand when interacting with them. You can duplicate an existing Spell Scroll. Doing so uses the same rules for "Scribing Spell Scrolls" (see PHB chapter 6) for the creation of the new scroll.

**Arcane Forgery.** When you scribe a Spell Scroll, you do not need to have the spell prepared if you posses a Spell Scroll with the desired spell inscribed on it. You must remain in possesion of this scroll for the entire duration of the crafting and you must still provide any material components required for the spell (consumed or otherwise).

\column

#### Level 2: Encyclopedic Knowledge
With the memory of an encyclopedia and a penchant for curiosity, you have memorized an impressive number of facts about various creatures. As a Bonus Action, you recall the following information about a creature you can see within 120 feet of yourself: **Size**, **Creature Type**, and **Known Languages**.

In addition, you may choose one of the following options; **Immunities**, **Vulnerabilities**, or **Resistances**. Make an Intelligence (Investigation) check with a DC of 15 to reveal one aspect of the chosen option, if the creature has any. The DM will choose which aspect is revealed if there are multiple.

You can use this feature twice. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest. When you reach certain Tactitician levels, you gain more uses of this feature, as shown in the Encyclopedia column of the Tactitician Features table.

#### Level 3: Tactitician Subclass
You gain a Tactitician subclass of your choice. The Perfectionist, Altruist, Doppelganger, and Experimenter subclasses are detailed after this class’s description. A subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Tactitician levels. For the rest of your career, you gain each of your subclass’s features that are of your Tactitician level or lower.

#### Level 4: Ability Score Improvement
You gain the Ability Score Improvement feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. You gain this feature again at Tactician levels 8,12, and 16.

#### Level 5: Investigative Mind
You gain proficiency in Intelligence (Investigation). If you already have proficiency in it, you gain Expertise in it.

#### Level 5: Cautious Nature
You are well experienced in navigating precarious situations and anticipating the actions of others. When you provoke an Opportunity Attack, the attacker has Disadvantage on the attack roll.

You have Advantage on Dexterity saving throws to avoid effects of or reduce damage from traps. You don't benefit from this feature if your Speed is 0 or you have the Incapacitated or Prone condition.

#### Level 7: Calculate the Odds
When you make an Intelligence check, you can treat a roll of 2 or lower on the d20 as a 3.

{{pageNumber 2}}
{{footnote PART 2 | CORE FEATURES}}

\page

#### Level 9: Efficient Duplication
With a steady hand and a keen mind, you have become more efficient when duplicating Spell Scrolls. You need less time and gold to craft a duplicated Spell Scroll.

**Arcane Forgery.** Roll a number of d4s equal to your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier and add the rolls together. Reduce the total crafting time of the new (duplicated) Spell Scroll by that many hours, to a minimum of 1 hour, and the cost by that much GP, to a minimum of 5 GP. At Tactitician level 13 these dice increase to d6s.

This bonus can only be applied to one crafted item at a time until that item is complete. If the bonus is applied to a new crafted item before the first is complete, the first crafted item cannot be finished and invested resources cannot be recovered.

#### Level 10: Mental Fortitude
You have Advantage on saving throws to avoid or end the Charmed, Frightened, or Restrained conditions.

#### Level 13: Adept Execution
When you can take the Attack Action, you may use a Spell Scroll of Level 0 (Cantrip). You can only use this feature once per turn.

#### Level 15: Preemptive Assessment
You constantly evaluate potential situations and preemptively prepare how you would react. You are rarely caught off guard.

**Initiative Bonus.** When you roll Initiative, you can add your Intelligence modifier to the roll. Alternatively, you can give this bonus to another creature within 20 feet of you. You can make this choice after Initiative has been rolled, but before any actions are taken.

#### Level 17: Precise Strikes
When you score a Critical Hit, you can roll one additional damage die when determining the extra damage the target takes. You gain advantage on the next spell attack roll you make before the end of your next turn.

\column

#### Level 18: Selective Studies
Choose two of the following enhancements

- **Arcane Mimicry** You gain 1 additional maximum use. You now regain 3 uses of this feature on a short rest.
- **Encyclopedic Knowledge** You gain 1 additional maximum use. When you succeed on the Investigation check, you know all Immunities, Vulnerabilities, or Resistances for that creature.
- **Calculate the Odds** When you make an Intelligence check, you can treat a roll of 4 or lower on the d20 as a 5.
- **Efficient Duplication** You gain 2 additional die when you roll to determine your time and cost bonus. You may reroll any one of the dice rolled for this feature one time. You must use the new roll.
- **Adept Execution** The level of the Spell Scroll increases to Level 2
- **Ability Score Improvement** You also gain this feature at Level 18. Any increases to ability scores from the level 18 enhancement of this feature, also increase your maximum for that score by the same amount. If another effect would raise your maximum for thoses score further, you also increase that maximum by the same amount. This increase cannot raise your maximum score above 30.

#### Level 19: Epic Boon
You gain an Epic Boon feat (see chapter 5) or another feat of your choice for which you qualify. Boon of Speed is recommended.

## Tactitician Subclasses
A Tactitician subclass is a specialization that grants you features at certain Tactitician levels, as specified in the subclass. This section presents the Perfectionist, Altruist, Doppelganger, and Experimenter subclasses.


### Perfectionist
*There is always efficiency to be found*

:

Your efforts have focused on the pursuit of knowledge and how to apply it with consistency and precision. You excel at calculating and predicting outcomes to maximize results.

#### Level 3: Repetition
Through repetition and focus, you have learned to consistently cast some of the most basic spells.

**Repetition.** After using a Spell Scroll of Level 0 (Cantrip), you can memorize the spell, or replace an already memorized spell. You can learn up to two cantrips in this way at a time. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells. You can learn an additional cantrip in this way at Tactitician level 6 and 14.

#### Level 6: Practiced
You have Advantage on Intelligence (Arcana) checks and when you take the utilize action on Intelligence and Dexterity Tools.

#### Level 11: Enhanced Execution

#### Level 14: Masterful Duplication
Your speed and efficiency in duplicating Spell Scrolls are unmatched.

**Arcane Forgery.** The bonus die increases to a number of d12s equal to your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier.

{{footnote PART 3 | SUBCLASSES}}

\page

### Altruist
*When we succeed, I succeed*

:

You have chosen to focus your mind on more altruistic pursuits. You prefer to apply your knowledge for the benefit of others and raise them up to great success, benefiting  yourself at the same time.

\column

#### Level 3: Calculated Support
When you target one or more allies with a spell cast from a Spell Scroll, choose one of the following effects added to the spell:
- **Encouraged** - Targetted creatures gain Advantage or Disadvantage (your choice) on the next d20 test they make within the next 1 minute.
- **Guided** - When targetted creatures roll any dice as a part of the spell being cast, they can choose the average roll (rounded up) for any number of dice of their choice for this spell.
- **Protected** - Targetted creatures gain temporary hit points equal to the spell's level + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1).

#### Level 3: Get What You Give
Supporting others fills you with a sense of accomplishment and fraternity. Once per turn, when you target one or more allies with a spell cast from a Spell Scroll, you gain temporary hit points equal to your Proficiency Bonus plus your Dexterity or Intelligence modifier.

#### Level 6: Rising Tide
**Raise it up.** As a Reaction, when another creature you can see with in 60 feet would make an ability check, before the roll you can give them your support and that creature adds 1d6 to that ability check. You can use this feature a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier per day. You regain one expended use when you finish a Short Rest and you regain all expended uses when you finish a Long Rest.

**Arcane Mimicry.** Your Arcane Mimicry now gains additional uses every second Tactitician level instead of every third. This increase applies retro actively (you now have 5 uses). At Tactitician level 14 you can use Spell Scrolls up to a level of your Intelligence and your Dexterity modifier combined.

#### Level 11: Teamwork
You are always a positive multiplier in team based crafting activities. When you help someone with a crafting activity (such as scribing a scroll from their spell list), you can also add the bonus from your Efficient Duplication (applied before the time reduction from helping). This still can't reduce a crafting activity to less than 1 Hour or 5 GP and can still only be applied to one crafted item at a time. 

You are not required to be proficient in the Tool required for crafting when helping someone in this way.

You may automatically succeed any Constitution saving throw to cast or to maintain concentration on the spell unless you are Incapacitated or Dead.

### Experimenter
*I think I've got it this time*

:

You choose to explore and play with new and exciting ways to utilize the magic stored in Spell Scrolls, even if it has some unpredictable effects. You have learned how to gain additional effects and with some luck, prevent a Spell Scroll from disintegrating after use.

#### Level 3: Liberal Interpretation
You have your own way of interpreting what is scribed which causes additional, but difficult to anticpate effects. When you cast a spell from a Spell Scroll, roll on the Surprise table to create an additional effect. A creature can only be affected by one of these effects at a time. If a new effect would be applied, the previous effect ends. You choose when the effect is applied in relation to the spell being cast.

##### Surprise
|1d12|Effect|
|:---:|---|
|1| For each level of the Spell Scroll used, a creature of your choice within a 30-foot radius of you gains temporary hit points equal to the spell's level + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) |
|2| For 1 minute, a creature of your choice within 30 feet gains resistance to one damage type. Roll 1d4 to determine the type: on a **1**, Acid; on a **2**, Force; on a **3**, Necrotic; on a **4**, Psychic. |
|3| For 1 minute, a creature of your choice within 30 feet gains vulnerability to one damage type. Roll 1d4 to determine the type: on a **1**, Cold; on a **2**, Poison; on a **3**, Radiant; on a **4**, Thunder.|
|4| A creature of your choice within 20 feet teleports to an unoccupied space you can see within 60 feet. |
|5| Copy the spell that was cast that triggered this effect, you may choose new targets. A copied spell is not considered as being cast from a Spell Scroll|
|6| For the next 2 minutes, a creature you can see within a 60-foot radius regains Hit Points at the begining of their turn equal to the spell's level + your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1) |
|7| Magical Darkness expands from you to fill a 15 foot Sphere centered on yourself. This effect lasts for 1 minute before dissipating and does not move with you. |
|8| In a 5-foot Emanation, all creatures and objects within range (excluding yourself) take Force damage equal to the spell's level + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of 1) and are pushed 5 feet away from you. |

|10| For 1 minute, a creature of your choice within a 30-foot radius gains a Fly Speed of the spell's level + 5. |
|11| For 1 minute, you have a bonus to your Armor Class equal to the level of the Spell Scroll used (minimum of 1) |

#### Level 6: Partial Reading
You attempt to stretch the limits of Spell Scrolls to use them in ways that don't cause them to disintegrate.
When you successfully cast a spell from a Spell Scroll, something may happen to the Spell Scroll. Roll 1d4 to determine the effect:
- On a **1**, the scroll begins to glow with unstable energy. As a Reaction you can throw it up to 5 feet away before it detonates and does Force damage equal to the scoll's level plus 1, in a 5 foot cube, audible up to 100 feet.
- On a **2-3**, Nothing happens, and the scroll disintegrates as normal.
- On a **4** or higher, make an Intelligence check with a DC equal to the level of the Spell Scroll. As a bonus to this roll, add either your Wisdom or Charisma modifier. If you succeed, the Spell Scroll is not consumed.

This die increases to 1d6 at Tactitician level 14.

#### Level 11: Unpredictable Scribing
In addition to duplicating a Spell Scroll, you can now attempt to scribe Spell Scrolls with unpredictable effects. Doing so uses the same rules for "Scribing Spell Scrolls" (see PHB chapter 6) for the creation of the new scroll.

When you scribe a new Spell Scroll, you do not need to have any specific spell prepared. You choose a level of Spell Scroll you would like to create. The creation of this scroll can benefit from your Efficient Duplication bonus. The newely created Spell Scroll contains a spell of your choice equal to the level of the crafted scroll, from a School in the School of Magic table below, determined by rolling 1d8. Before the magic of the Spell Scroll becomes active (and crafting is considered complete), you must supply any required materials for the spell now that you know what kind of Spell Scroll it is you managed to create.

##### School of Magic
|1d8|School| |1d8|School|
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|:---|
|1|Abjuration||5|Evocation|
|2|Conjuration||6|Illusion|
|3|Divination||7|Necromancy|
|4|Enchantment||8|Transmutation|

#### Level 14: Influence Outcome
When you roll on the Suprise table, roll an additional 2d12. You may choose up to 2 options on the table from the values rolled. You may choose an effect more than once for each die that rolled it. You must choose at least one effect.

When you roll on the School of Magic table, roll an additional 1d8. You can choose either value rolled.

\column

#### Level 20: Variable Augmentation
Your experimentation with the boundaries of the arcane and the metaphysical have begun to take hold within you.

Whenever you complete a Long Rest, gain a temporary +6 bonus to one ability score. This bonus can exceed your current maximum for that ability score, but cannot exceed a total 30. This effect only persists for 24 hours or until the next time you benefit from a Long Rest. To determine which ability score is increased roll 1d6 on the Variable Augmentation table.

**Experiment.** Whenever you make a roll on a table associated with the Experimenter Subclass, you may reroll one of those dice but you must use that die as one of your choices. (This does not apply to Partial Reading as it is not a table)

##### Variable Augmentation
|1d6|Ability|
|:---:|:---|
|1|Strength|
|2|Dexterity|
|3|Constitution|
|4|Intelligence|
|5|Wisdom|
|6|Charisma|
