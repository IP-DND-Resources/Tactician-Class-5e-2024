## Summary
The Tactician has studied for many years to gain knowledge and skills. They are experts in applying their intellect in novel and effective ways. Not all Tacticians come from acedemic or studious backgrounds. Some learned to survive the harsh streets using their wit and quick thinking. Others have taken up countless trades and moved from job to job, taking a bit from each experience with them. The Tacticians mind is one that excels at problem solving and applying solutions quickly, efficiently, and with precision. Having been told most of their life they have what it takes to be whatever they want to be, they choose to be what they already are; a master of adaptation and inginuity.
