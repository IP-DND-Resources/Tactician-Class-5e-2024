# Tactician FAQ
## Core Features

### Arcane Mimicry
#### Do I still need to pass an Intelligence (Arcana) check when using Level 0 (Cantrip) Spell Scrolls via this feature?
You certainly do :D

This feature gives you access to Spell Scrolls not on your spell list. This is pretty similar to the level 13 feature for the Rogue subclass, Thief.

{{note
PHB (2024) Pg 137; Use Magic Device (Scrolls) 

You can use any Spell Scroll, [...] If the spell is a cantrip or a level 1 spell, you can cast it reliably. If the scroll contains a higher-level spell, you must first succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check (DC 10 plus the spell's level). On a successful check, you cast the spell from the scroll. On a failed check, the scroll disintegrates.
}}

While the Thief is able to cast Cantip and Level 1 Spell Scrolls reliably (with out chance of failure via a check), you still can fail. The total DC for a Cantrip is 10. Allowing use of an Arcana vs just a straight Spellcasting Ability check in the standard Spell Casting rules is meant to decrease the likely hood of failure while still allowing for it.

#### How does this limit apply to using Cantrip Spell Scrolls that I know or have prepared from other features?
##### Spell Source: Class (and Subclass) Spell List (Multiclass)

{{note
PHB (2024) Pg 228; Spell Scroll 

If the spell is on your class's spell list [...].
}}

This does extend to "Subclass" in the case of Arcane Trickster or Eldritch Knight by way of the Spellcasting feature giving them access to the Wizard spell list.

This feature **does not limit** the use of Spell Scrolls from your class, subclass, or multiclass spell list using the normal casting rules.

##### Spell Source: Magic Initiate (Feat)
This feat teaches you spells and adds them to your prepared spell list. These spells are considered to be known outside of what is considered *your* "class list" (even though you select the spell *from* a specific class list).

[Discussion Thread](https://rpg.stackexchange.com/questions/132036/does-learning-a-spell-through-the-magic-initiate-feat-allow-me-to-cast-that-spel)

- RAW: This feature **does limit** the use of Spell Scrolls, even if prepared via a feat.
- DM Discretion: Your DM may decide to relax this to "You must have a spell prepared **or** on your class list to use a Spell Scroll with that spell inscribed."

##### Spell Source: Racial/Species
Similar to Magic Initiate (Feat), the spell learned in this manner, even though it is *prepared*, is not specifically associated with a spell list *you* have.

This feature **does limit** the use of Spell Scrolls, even if available from a racial or species feature..

##### Spell Source: Subclass feature
Various Subclass', such as Celestial Patron (Warlock), or Fey Wanderer (Ranger), give you access to additional spells via their features. While you do have these spells *prepared*, unless they are explicitly stated as being considered part of the class's Spell List, they are not.

This feature **does limit** the use of Spell Scrolls, even if prepared via another source.

#### When I cast a Cantrip Spell Scroll, do I benefit from level scaling?
Yes, When casting a Cantrip (Level 0) from a Spell Scroll, the Cantrip scales appropriately with your character level.

For example, If you are character level 5, a Spell Scroll insribed with Chill Touch, would roll 2d10 for damage.

{{note
PHB (2024) Pg 233; Cantrips

If the scribed spell is a cantrip, the version on the scroll works as if the caster were your level.
}}

#### What Spell Save DC and Spell Attack should I use?
RAW: All Spell Scrolls use a static Spell Save DC and Spell Attack Bonus

{{note
DMG (2024) Pg 305; Spell Scroll

The level of the spell on the scroll determines the spell's saving throw DC and attack bonus, as well as the scroll's rarity, as shown in the following table.
}}

|Spell Level|Rarity|Save DC|Attack Bonus|
|:---:|:---|:---:|:---:|
|Cantrip|Common		|13|+5|
|1		|Common		  |13|+5|
|2		|Uncommon	  |13|+5|
|3		|Uncommon	  |15|+7|
|4		|Rare		    |15|+7|
|5		|Rare		    |17|+9|
|6		|Very Rare	|17|+9|
|7		|Very Rare	|18|+10|
|8		|Very Rare	|18|+10|
|9		|Legendary	|19|+11|

#### How is a Spell with Concentration or Ritual handled?
Pretty much the same as a spell being cast with a spell slot, with the scroll being an analog for the spell slot.

##### Concentration
When a spell with concentration is cast from a Spell Scroll, it functions identially as if the spell was cast by any other means. The caster must maintain Concentration, or the spell effect ends early. The Spell Scroll is consumed once the spell casting is complete.

##### Ritual
When a spell with the Ritual tag is cast from a Spell Scroll, it functions similarly as if the spell was cast by any other means. The caster must maintain concentration for the duration of the casting. Similarly to the loss of a spell slot, the Spell Scroll is **not** consumed until the casting is complete. Spell Scrolls are consumed either at the completion of casting or the failure to pass a required Intelligence (Arcana) check.

{{note
DMG (2024) Pg 305; Spell Scroll

Once the spell is cast, the scroll crumbles to dust. If the casting is interrupted, the scroll isn't lost
}}

Spell Scrolls can be effectively thought of as a physical spell slot.

### Broad Exposure (Organized)
##### I think a Pouch should be able to hold X, why was 6 chosen?
A Pouch has 1/5th cubic feet (345 inches cubed) of space. A 2" cylinder that is 12" long (A rolled up parchment scroll of 18" long by 12" wide) is about 56.55 inches cubed. This works out nicely when considering weight to volume ratios for Pouch contents (if your group uses this). If a Pouch can carry .2 cubic feet or 6 lbs, this means you could carry 2 Potions of Healing (.5 lbs ea), 2 lbs of Rations, and 3 Spell Scrolls. All of this is of course up to DM discretion and open to intepretation. A Map or Scroll Case can carry (RAW) 5 sheets of parchment, so about 5 Spell Scrolls.

### Duplicate (Arcane Forgery)
#### Can I scribe Spell Scrolls with prepared spells from other sources?
Yes. If you know a cantrip or have a spell prepared from another feature, the crafting rules only require you to be proficient in Intelligence (Arcana) or Calligrapher's Tools, and to have that spell prepared on each day of the inscription. This feature just gives an alternative to having the spell prepared.

This feature **does not** limit the creation of Spell Scrolls of spells you have prepared (or know) from other features.

#### DMG vs PHB Crafting Ambiguity - What proficiencies do I need?

:

{{note
DMG (2024) Pg 220; Crafting Magic Items | Arcana Proficiency

To craft a magic item, you and any assistants must have proficiency in the Arcana skill. Tools You must use the required tool to make an item and have proficiency with that tool. Any assistances must also have proficiency with it

</br>

DMG (2024) Pg 221; Magic Item Tools 

Scroll - Calligrapher's Tools
}}

:

{{note
PHB (2024) Pg 233; Prerequisites for the Scribe 

To scribe a scroll, you must have proficiency in the Arcana skill *or* with Calligrapher's Tools [...]
}}

This is a bit of a contradiction. Since the DMG came out after the PHB and it much more explicit, it is reasonable to assume that this ambiguity is a mistake in the PHB, fixed in the DMG. Regardless, proficiency with Arcana **and** Calligrapher's Tools is given at level 1, so that Tacticians can always scribe and duplicate scrolls. This is considered a key class identity, much like a Rogue with Thieves's Tools.

**Note** - Teamwork (Altruist) does alter this rule when helping someone else craft

### Encyclopedic Knowledge
At DM discretion, the creature you are attempting to Investigate, may be so rare or novel that there is no possible way you could "recall" this additional information. This can be communicated as "There are none that you could have possibly recalled". It is reccomended that a DM still provide type, size, and at least one language, as those can typically be gleaned from apparent observations. As always, this is up to DM discretion.

### Efficient Duplication (Arcane Forgery)
#### When are materials and gold consumed?
When crafting items over multiple days, you typically pay crafting costs incrementally over the course of crafting (XGte). When you apply the bonus reduction, you should apply that bonus evenly across the total calculated (reduced) time if your DM is using incremental crafting rules.

{{note
XGte (2017) Pg 128; Crafting an Item

For every workweek of downtime, you make progress toward crafting the item equal to 25 gp per day spent [...]
}}

This is typically adapted to per-day or per-week depending on the scale of crafting.

RAW: Consumed materials are consumed completely at the beginning of crafting. Gold is consumed incrementally with each day or week or completely at the beginning of crafting (DM discretion). Other non-consumed required materials must be available at all times during scribing.

#### When receiving crafting help, what bonuses apply first?
Flat bonuses first, followed by multiplicative.

When one or more characters help with crafting, this bonus should be applied first before applying the bonus from help.

##### Example
An ally is assisting you with crafting (or duplicating) a Level 3 Spell Scroll and you are Tactician level 13. You have an Intelligence modifier of +4, so you roll 4d6, and the total is 16. It normally requires 5 days (40 hours) and 150 GP.

You would first reduce the total hours to 24 (3 days), and the total GP to 134. You then apply the reducion from receiving help (0.5 multiplier) reducing the totals to 12 hours and 134 GP.

### Adept Execution
#### Does the Spell Scroll used require and consume a use of Arcane Mimicry?
if you can't otherwise use the Spell Scroll (via a class's spell list), then yes.

### Enhanced Execution
#### Can the bonus dice be applied to the Arcana check determining if the Spell Scroll succeeds?
No. The effect only applies once the spell is being cast. The Arcana check determines if the spell is cast in the first place.

#### Can the bonus dice be applied to the chance to hit on a Spell Attack roll?
Sure! You just have to make it clear you are doing so before you roll for attack, not after.

## Altruist

### Calculated Support
#### Does Encouraged apply to the d20 test chosen by the spell Guidance?
Yes. It even would apply to a a d20 test **not** chose, but the 1d4 bonus still only works on the chosen skill.

#### Does Guided apply to the d20 test chosen by the spell Guidance?
No. The d20 test is referenced by, but not part of the spell being cast. This bonus would however, apply to the 1d4 being rolled, guaranteeing a +3 to that check.

#### Why is Extended not allowed on spells with Concentration or the Ritual tag?
Partially because Concentration is really meant to limit the efficacy and proliferation of exceptionally strong spells and limit spellcaster power. Some spells that require Concetration or have the Ritual tag are either quite broken (overpowered) or become broken (inoperable) when they have multiple targets beyond their intended number.

#### If I combine Restored, Guided, and Amplified, and they choose to take the 1d8 of healing (over regaining 1 hit die), what would happen?
Lets assume you cast a spell like Lesser Restoration and you have the Camaraderie feature. You choose Restored, Guided, and Amplified as the additional effects, and the Poisoned condition was removed from your target. Since Restored is added to the spell, it would be considered "part of the spell being cast" for Guided, and similarly for Amplified. That ally would choose between regaining 1 hit die, or rolling 1d8 of healing. If they choose to roll the 1d8, that is also part of the effect of the spell, and Amplified would add 1d8. The target would now have 2d8 to roll and could then choose to take the average roll (rounded up) from Guided, for a total of 10 points of healing in addition to the Poison condition being removed.

#### What is considered a "detrimental status effect" for Restored?
In a literal sense, any actual negative status effect.

However, this is a game of creativity and freedom, with countless house rules and homebrew features. Imagine an ally is under the Indifferent effect of Calm Emotions, and you cast Dispel Magic to end it. Did you remove a detrimental effect? Some would say yes! Others may say "Indifference is not a detrimental effect!" What if this is in combat, and that Indifference prevents a Ranger from attacking a tough enemy?

There are too many corner cases to try to address, so it is left up to the DM to determine "does this spell being cast remove an effect that is currently detrimental?"

### Rising Tide (Arcane Mimicry)
#### Do I gain additional uses at both every second and every third Tactician level?
No. Instead of gaining additional uses at Tactician levels 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18; You now gain an additional use of Arcane Mimicry at Tactician levels 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20.

### Teamwork
#### Can team work apply to crafting items other Spell Scrolls?
Yes.

#### What happens if the Teamwork bonus is applied to an item being crafted, and then its switched to a new item. Can the ally finish the first item?
No. The first item would not be able to be completed. The specialized help being provided by the Tactician's Teamwork feature is customized and complex, and without their help the ally wont be sure how to finish the item.

DM Discretion: The DM may choose to rule that the item now requires an adjusted time and gold cost as if Teamwork was never applied that must be fulfilled before crafting is complete.

### Camaraderie
#### DM Note
Feel free to add/change the list of spells. The intent is for them to be powerful supporting spells that can target allies. Healing, shielding, damage reductions, buffs, etc.

#### So you're telling me I can cast Haste on 4 party member's even though it has Concentration?
Yeah buddy! Isn't that a neat thing to be able to do every three days as a capstone ability? Seems fine, right? RIGHT?!!?!

Same with Otiluke's Resilient Sphere. The reasoning of why this is ok is
1) The caster that has to maintain concentration is still vulnerable, and if they get blown up, the effect ends.
2) You're level 20, live a little.

##### That seems WAY too good!
Maybe, but don't forget the cooldown is multiple days, so its really just a powerful once-in-awhile effect that is simplified by using well known spells.

### Impersonate
#### Can I use the Metmagic option learned from Micromagic on a spell cast from a Spell Scroll?
Yes. These all qualify for use with a spell *cast* from a Spell Scroll. This is the same for Millimagic also.

{{note
PHB (2024) Pg 228; Spell Scroll 

[...] you can read the scroll and cast the spell [...]
}}

{{note
PHB (2024) Pg 141; Metamagic Options 

When you cast a spell [...] When you roll damage for a spell [...] If you make an attack roll for a spell[...]
}}

### Millimagic
#### Can I choose a Metamagic option that costs 2 Sorcery Points?
Yes.

### Copy Spell (Clone)
#### What happens if I cast a Level 9 spell and I already have 3 or more levels of Exhaustion?
You die.

{{note
PHB (2024) Pg 366: (Condition) Exhaustion

You die if your Exhaustion level is 6. 
}}

It should be assumed this means "level 6 or higher."

#### Can I scribe this spell onto a Spell Scroll?
Yes! All that is required is that you have the spell prepared on each day of crafting and that you have proficiency with Calligrapher's Supplies and the Arcana skill. Keep in mind though, this feature lets you memorize a spell that may be of a higher level than Arcane Mimicry would allow you to cast from a Spell Scroll, since the spell still wouldn't be on any 'spell list' you have. An ally could perhaps cast it however.

#### Can I memorize a spell I just cast from a Spell Scroll?
Absolutely! That is, unless you somehow couldn't observe yourself casting it?

## Experimenter

### Partial Reading
#### What kind of Intelligence check (skill) is rolled on a 4 or higher?
None, its just a straight Intelligence check (with the additional modifier bonus). The intent is to limit the efficacy of Proficiency on the probability of succeeding. As Spell Scroll levels increase, there needs to be a higher likelyhood of the Spell Scroll being consumed eventually the higher it's level.

##### Math!
Lets assume a Tactician Level of 14 and an Intelligence Modifier of +4 and a secondary modifier of +2. There is a 50% chance for the d6 to come up 4 or higher. 

For a **level 0 (Cantrip) Spell Scroll**, we need a 4 or higher on the d20 to pass a DC 10. That gives a subsequent 85% chance (17 divided by 20 = 0.85), which reduces the overall likelyhood of a level 0 Spell Scroll not disintegrating to approximately 42.5%. (0.5 * 0.85)

For a **level 3 Spell Scroll**, we need a 7 or higher on the d20 to pass a DC 13. That gives a subsequent 70% chance (14 divided by 20 = 0.7), which reduces the overall likelyhood of a level 3 Spell Scroll not disintegrating to approximately 35%. (0.5 * 0.7)

For a **level 5 Spell Scroll**, we need a 9 or higher on the d20 to pass a DC 15. That gives a subsequent 60% chance (12 divided by 20 = 0.6), which reduces the overall likelyhood of a level 5 Spell Scroll not disintegrating to approximately 30%. (0.5 * 0.60)

### Liberal Interpretation
#### If I target a creature with a spell that deals Cold damage and I roll a 3 on the Surprise table, can I have the vulnerability apply before damage?
Yes! "You choose when the effect is applied in relation to the spell being cast."

The wording is intended to allow you the flexibility to apply the effect in the best way possible for the situation. Randomness can be fun when it's beneficial, and frustrating when its clunky.

Rolling a 4 after casting Thunderclap seems like a hoot!

### Unpredictable Scribing
#### What happens if I choose to not finish crafting the Spell Scroll after rolling the School of Magic table?
You could abandon crafting and forfeit any time and resources expended thus far. You are not required to complete an item you are crafting. You could also just leave the unfinished item for later. If you applied the Efficient Duplication bonus, you would have to finish the item before being able to use this bonus again, or the unfinished item would be similarly forfeit.

Think of it as "the last step" to finish crafting the item.

### Experiment (Variable Augmentation)
#### Is this reroll available when rolling for Variable Augmentation?
Yes! It would be a bit lackluster if you roll an undesired ability and your capstone does functionally nothing for you for the day. At least if you roll an undesired ability twice in a row you get to have a good laugh about it.
